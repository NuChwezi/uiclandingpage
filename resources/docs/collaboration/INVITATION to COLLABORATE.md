**PROJECT**: A UIC WEB LANDING PAGE

**OBJECTIVE**: To define and boost the image of UIC, the core Uganda Internet Community, as well as help market the entity to the rest of the world via the internet. Ultimately, help UIC get off the ground and grow into something formidable!

**STATUS**: Currently, UIC mostly exists on Telegram only (https://t.me/ugandanow), however, a draft landing page for the World Wide Web has been manifested at https://uic.nuchwezi.com

**NEXT STEPS**: Take that existing draft landing page, and enhance it to make it more effective at marketing UIC to the rest of the world, as well as helping it become the main official front-face for the Internet Community that's likely to shape the future of Internet Activism locally and globally.

**YOUR ASSIGNMENT**: Engage and have fun evolving the draft website into something perfect. Use any resources you wish to, any language, but, keep it mostly light-weight, strictly responsive, definitely simple and as a Single-Page-App. Preferably, just stick to HTML, CSS and basic JS.

**YOUR REWARD**: At the moment, can't promise much, because UIC is still just a voluntary undertaking by a bunch of ambitious netizens and the Internet President, however, if your inputs produce something worthwhile, you'll be entitled to a mention in the rest of the page's future, and can also reference the work in your CV/portfolio once it goes online. That's about it for now.
